# Version
Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used by adding the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Each model excels at producing different types of images.
--version accepts the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 5.1.
--version can be abbreviated --v
## Default Model Version 5.1
The Midjourney V5.1 model is the newest and most advanced, released on May 4th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5.1 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5Ô∏è‚É£ MJ Version 5.1
This model has a stronger default aesthetic, making it easier to use with simple text prompts. It also has high Coherency, excels at accurately interpreting natural language prompts, produces fewer unwanted artifacts and borders, has increased image sharpness, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile
### Model Version 5.1 + Style Raw Parameter
Midjourney Model Version 5.1 can be fine-tuned with the --style parameter--raw to remove some of the default Midjourney aesthetic style.
